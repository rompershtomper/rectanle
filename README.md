# Calculate_area

This is a learning task.

Wroten by me:
 [RectanglesTask.cs](https://github.com/rompershtomper/Calculate_area/blob/master/RectanglesTask.cs)
    
The methods takes as arguments the coordinates of two rectangle:
    if they intersect, returns their area;
    if one is inscribed in another, returns number of inscrided.
